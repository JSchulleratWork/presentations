### What is Infrastructure Testing

@ul
- Does this port respond?
- Is this service running?
- Is the current state what I expect?
@ulend

### Why Test Infrastructure

@ul
- To validate our **CURRENT** state matches our **EXPECTED** state
- To notify us when they differ
- To perform sanity checks before **AND** after changes
- To provide guardrails for automation
@ulend

### So Why Do We Test Again?

@ul
- So we can go [blue]**FAST**
- So we can be [green]**SAFE**
- So we can bail when things are [red]**UNSAFE**
